# Zephyr Digital Agency Website
Zephyr is my take on a digital agency website which I created for the CS50 week 8 problem set.

## The project requirements
The requirements for the CS50 week 8 problem set were pretty basic and as follows:
1. Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript
2. Have at least four different pages
3. Use at least one Bootstrap feature - I will admit I didn't use Bootstrap here I prefer to do it manually that way I learn how to do it myself
4. Have at least one stylesheet
5. Use at least ten different HTML tags
6. Integrate at least one feature into the website with javascript
7. Make the website responsive
